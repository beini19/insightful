I thought that the plaza was bland and dead. Then this place came along and brought salvation on to Waterloo. No I'm joking, but this place does taste really fantastic. Having been to Lanzhou myself I think that the flavor here is pretty ...

Handpulled noodles are pretty good. Broth is tasty, chili is not that hot, but flavourful. You can order tendon during the weekend. Portions are an insane size, even if you get the smallest one. Great value for students, and this is ...

Best Chinese Ramen (Pulled-Noodle) in town...and best in Ontario too! This place is always busy. Be prepared. Their soup broth is just outstanding! Staff are excellent too! 10 star!

The best noodles in the plaza, and perhaps even best in Waterloo (that I have tried so far). Portions are very good for the price, especially for a large bowl of soup noodles. Quality is superb, especially considering the mixed bag you ...

Amazing noodles: I prefer the thinnest size as it picks up the broth so well. A bit slow on service, but they're gradually improving. Great place to go for a warm meal.

Finally, a good noodle place in Waterloo! They handmake their noodles here and you can definitely taste (and see!) the quality. Portion sizes are very good. Their prices are okay (appetizers are a bit expensive) and service is okay. My ...

New genre of Chinese noodle place at the plaza. If you’re hungry, go for their large size noodle soup. (It’s filling...) They offer various sizes/diameter of the noodle. I recommend the thin ones, because they get cooked much more ...

It was very difficult to call servers over, and we had to ask multiple times for them to bring something. Value of the large bowl is amazing - its a REALLY large bowl, but the broth itself tasted pretty basic. The chili oil had no ...

When you walk into this place, you might get immediately get the feeling you've found something special—that feeling is absolutely correct.

While my friend and I (very briefly) waited for a table, I watched a cook painstakingly place ...

Very authentic flavors! Always a line outside so be ready for that. Moderate prices for the serving size. Not many items on the menu but each item is quite good!

Wow! For it's price, the portions are amazing. Regular is like a large bowl in other places and large is soooooooo much! Tastes great as well! This can be reinforced by the fact that their menu is very small, which means they are good at ...

When I went the service was horrible. They seated us and completely forgot about us. We tried to wave down a server several times but they always said they’re will be right back. At one point another couple came in after we were waiting ...
